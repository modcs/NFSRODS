What's new or changed in 0.9.22
===============================

Garrett Cooper reported that Andy Levine found a bug
where the "no_all_squash" option is unusable due to a
spelling mistake in the options parser. This is fixed now.

Wesley Shields reported build problems on more recent
FreeBSD systems which are fixed now.

Bernhard Duebi reported problems with filesystem size
reporting when using a Solaris Zone. This is fixed now.

The BUGS section of the manpage has been updated to
explicitly list the permissions that UNFS3 will need
for exported directories and the parents of exported
directories.
